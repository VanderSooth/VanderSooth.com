This is the homepage for VanderSooth Entertainment, a company which is being formed to promote a book series titled "The Legend of VanderSooth" starting with Book 1: The Twins of Atlantis.

The series is intended to follow the 11 year old twins as they mature on the "continent of Atlantis," which Plato said had blown up and sank, but THAT was "The Big Lie" originated by the "Council of Atlantis" and perpetuated by sea-going lumberjacks, a well-meaning somewhat rowdy bunch that like to sing songs.  The reason for "The Big Lie" is that all the world powers, since Plato's time, had always come and conquered the peaceful people of Atlantis, so they decided they would "hide" from them.

However, a terrible "Cataclysm" that has been fabled forever, is suddenly being foretold as being imminent.  It is prophesized by the Gypsies and confirmed by the Oracle (queen of the witches) and the Council of Atlantis (composed of the kings and queens of all 10 kingdoms) is warned of it's approach.  Then the King of Hamlet is informed his children (the twins) must journey with Merlin (his trusted advisor and very wise apothecary) along with the sailors in order to acquire the knowledge and skills they will need to be able to protect Atlantis from the Cataclysm.  Book 1 ends with the children setting off with the sailors to voyage out into the Roman Empire of 116 AD.

The aim of the book is to foster a love of learning in young readers.  In the course of reading the book youngsters will learn good vocabulary words, scientific analysis skills, and engineering principles, while journeying through the Ancient Roman world (a history lesson).

VanderSooth Entertainment was formed because we are VERY ENTHUSIASTIC about the mission of the author, and believe that mission is fulfilled by this first book.  However, we (and the author) are not experienced publishers, and we are hopeful that the mission will be best fulfilled if a professional publisher embraces the book series.

If so, we believe a theater and movie are likely to follow, hence our choice of "Entertainment" in our business name.  We have even introduced some songs into the book, to pave the way for future expansion.

To attract a professional publisher we have decided to produce a Kickstarter Campaign, to back a "Publisher's Manuscript" version of Book 1.  We are hopeful this campaign will result in a publishing contract.

To demonstrate our commitment to education, we are funding a Scholarship Contest with $500.00 to be paid to the (United States of America, only) college and/or university the winning applicant(s) will be attending, and we are hoping that, via the Kickstarter campaign, that prize can be increased to a capped amount.  If successful, we intend to form a non-profit for the purpose of awarding future scholarships.

All the persons involved are either "newbies" or amateur in every field we are venturing into, including building websites.  We are also all of very limited means, so we are on a penny pinching budget.  We apologize for the "unrefined" products and webpages we are producing, but if our launch is successful, we will certainly improve!
